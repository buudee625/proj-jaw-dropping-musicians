# Jaw Dropping Musicians

## These musicians will bring your jaws to the floor!

Jaw dropping musicians, aka JDMusician, is an open-source collection of musicians who are not well known in the general public sense but possess the most otherworldly talents.

Quite literally, when you watch them perform their craft, they make you drop your jaw.
